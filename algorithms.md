## Graphs (W1D1)

### How do we define a graph mathematically?

### What is the difference between directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted?

### Give an example of various types of graphs (Weighted Undirected, Unweighted Directed, Unweighted Undirected, etc.)

### What makes a graph a simple graph? What attributes would make it not simple?

### What is the maximum number of edges in a directed simple graph? Undirected simple graph? Answer should be in terms of `N`.

### Describe the levels of connectivity a graph can have (strongly connected, weakly connected).

### What are cycles?

### What are some naive ways we can store and traverse graphs? Be able to discuss time/space complexity of these approaches, and what issues we may face.

## Graph Adjacency Matrix / List (W1D2)

### Give a high level overview of an Adjacency Matrix.

### If we were only concerned about time complexity, is an Adjacency Matrix efficient? Why/why not?

### If we were only concerned about space complexity, is an Adjacency Matrix efficient? Why/why not?

### Give a high level overview of an Adjacency List.

### What benefits do we get from an Adjacency List?
