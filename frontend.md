## JavaScript | Prototypes (W1D1)

### Give a high level overview of what an object's prototype represents.
An object's prototype is the template object from which it inherits. ([Object Prototypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes))

### What are the differences between the `__proto__` and `prototype` attributes?
The `__proto__` attribute is an accessor property of `Object.prototype` object. It exposes the internal prototype linkage of an object through which it is accessed. ([JavaScript Inheritance](https://hackernoon.com/understand-nodejs-javascript-object-inheritance-proto-prototype-class-9bd951700b29))

`__proto__` is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. `prototype` is the object that is used to build `__proto__` when you create an object with `new`. `prototype` is the blueprint for `__proto__`. ([`__proto__` vs `prototype`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9959727/proto-vs-prototype-in-javascript))

### What happens when we do or don't explicity set an object's prototype?

### What are the valid values for an object's prototype?
